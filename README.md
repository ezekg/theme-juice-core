# Theme Juice Core
[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/theme-juice/theme-juice-core.svg)

This repository contains the core framework for creating applications using [Theme Juice](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-starter). The core mainly handles rendering the `<head>` and `<body>` sections of the site, while providing an extensible package system and a streamlined asset handler for including CSS and JS into a project.

_More documentation coming soon (hopefully)._
